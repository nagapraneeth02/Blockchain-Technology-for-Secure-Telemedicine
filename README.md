# Blockchain-Technology-for-Secure-Telemedicine
This project explores the integration of blockchain technology in telehealth and telemedicine to enhance data security, patient privacy, and trust in remote healthcare services. It addresses the challenges of data breaches, identity theft, and unauthorized access by implementing decentralized identity management, encrypted data storage, smart contracts for access control, and immutable audit trails.

Using blockchainâ€™s transparency, immutability, and security, the proposed system ensures secure storage and sharing of Electronic Health Records (EHRs), overcoming limitations of traditional consent management and improving patient data accessibility for healthcare providers.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
- Decentralized Identity Management â€“ Secure authentication for patients and providers
- Encrypted Data Storage â€“ Blockchain-based security for sensitive health records
- Smart Contracts for Access Control â€“ Automating permissions and reducing unauthorized access
- Immutable Audit Trail â€“ Ensuring data integrity, accountability, and transparency

ðŸ”¹ Impact & Validation:
- Reduces data breaches and identity theft risks in telemedicine
- Enhances patient trust in remote healthcare services
- Provides secure, streamlined sharing of medical records across healthcare providers
- Improves compliance with regulatory standards like HIPAA

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack:
ðŸ”¹ Blockchain (Ethereum/Hyperledger)
ðŸ”¹ Smart Contracts (Solidity)
ðŸ”¹ Secure Data Encryption (AES, SHA-256)
ðŸ”¹ EHR Integration

- Future Work:
- Expansion to integrate AI-driven analytics for predictive healthcare
- Enhancing interoperability with existing EHR systems
